# thermo-disk
thermo-disk is a MATLAB‑based explicit finite‑difference solver for transient radial heat transfer in a thin copper disk, developed as a 2013 interview home task. It computes and visualizes the time‑dependent temperature evolution under fixed internal heating and insulated outer boundary.
